Saving Throw: Death -3

Much like the finger of death spell, this spell attempts to snuff the life out of it's target.  The caster utters the incantation, points <PRO_HISHER> index finger at the creature to be slain, and unless the victim makes a Save vs. Death -3, the victim dies instantly. Even if the save is successful, however, the brush with death still inflicts 15d6 points of magic damage. Characters slain by Extract Soul find that their soul is trapped by the spell, and they are bound to this world for a time as a ghost under the command of the caster.

- Second, each warded creature gains spell resistance 50%.
- Third, the abjuration protects the recipient from all charm and domination effects.
- Finally, if a creature succeeds on a melee attack against a creature warded by a divine aura, the offending attacker is blinded unless a save vs spell is made, lasting 3 rounds.~

Duration: 2 turns

Unlike the 7th-level Contingency spell, the priest can set the target to be <PRO_HIMHER>self, the last creature to hit <PRO_HIMHER>, or the nearest enemy. Spells of 7th level or lower can be used in the contingency.

Sphere: Affliction
Range: Visual range of caster
Duration: 1 Turn
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: 40' radius
Saving Throw: Neg.

This spell is destructive and irreversible. When invoked, it enrages the land, so it will attempt to destroy all creatures in its area of effect. Every creature takes 1D10 points of Poison and 1D10 points of Acid damage each round it is exposed to the deadly vapors. If someone fails a saving throw vs. poison at -2, he becomes poisoned. Another failed save vs. poison results in disease, and the victim will lose one point of Constitution for 5 rounds. This spell destroys all summoned creatures. Besides its destructive powers, Nature's Wrath has a more vicious characteristic: it attempts to stop, or at least slow, creatures fleeing the area of effect. Any target must save vs. spells at -4, or becomes entangled for a short time. Entangled creatures can still attack.
