@10101 = ~incarnate~
@10102 = ~Incarnate~
@10103 = ~INCARNATE: Often called, "Chosen", Incarnates are 'natural' priests, with little or no connection to any church hierarchy. It is less true to say that they choose their deity than they are 'chosen' by a given deity (whether they like it or not) for their temperament, and natural connection to divine magic. Often peasants, they typically have few skills or other special training.

Advantages:
- Divine Favor: Incarnates gain special unique abilities that are not available to other clerics, including specialized priests of the same deity.
Disadvantages:
- Is not proficient with armor, shields or helmets.~

@10104 = ~acolyte~
@10105 = ~Acolyte~
@10106 = ~ACOLYTE: Also known as "Archivists" or "Cloisters", Acolytes are especially pious and studious clerics that rarely venture beyond abbey walls. However, when they do go adventuring, their skills and spells are quite useful, even if they lack combat training typical of most clerics.

CLASS FEATURES:

- Devoted Servant: Acolytes always get more bonus spells than other clerics of the same deity as the have spent years cultivating a connection with that deity through rigorous ritual and meditation. As such, they gain +1 spell per spell level.
- Sphere Focus: Acolytes gain access to spells earlier than other priests.  They gain access to spells one level earlier to their deity's favored sphere.

Disadvantages:
- Can only wear leather armors
- Gains only d6 HD per level.

@20001 = ~ur-priest~
@20002 = ~Ur-Priest~
@20003 = ~UR-PRIEST: Ur-Priests are heretical practitioners that have found a way to wrest divine power from the gods with the use of ancient and forbidden rituals.  As might be expected, this behavior is frowned upon by the gods, and Ur-Priests have to keep their profession secret or risk persecution or worse.

Advantages:
- Sphere Access: Very high access.  The Ur-Priest gains major access to all spheres except the life, benediction, plant, animal and light spheres.
- Sap the Spirit: Ur-Priests can use the same techniques to drain living beings of their divine essence in much the same way they do so from the gods; though, of course, mortals do not have much of a divine essence, and so the benefits of this ability are limited.
This ability can be used once per day at fifth level.  The Ur-Priest can use Sap the Spirit an additional time per day at levels 10, 15 and 20.

SAP THE SPIRIT: This ability deals 1d4 magic damage to a living target per 4 levels of the Ur-Priest (2d4 at 5th level; maximum 6d4 at 20th level).
Beginning at 5th level, if the Ur-Priest kills a target with this ability, <PRO_HESHE> casts priest spells at +1 level for 5 rounds.  
At 10th level, if the Ur-Priest kills a target with this ability, <PRO_HESHE> also gains the benefits of the spell, Wondrous Recall.

Disadvantages:
- Cannot Turn Undead
- The rituals tax the Ur-Priest, making them more vulnerable to the effects of disease and magic.  They gain a -2 penalty to save vs. death and spells.

Deity access: None, despises the gods.

Restrictions: Cannot be of a good or lawful alignment~

@20101 = ~cleric of lathander~
@20102 = ~Dawnbringer of Lathander~
@20103 = ~DAWNBRINGER OF LATHANDER: Dawnbringers are the representatives of Lathander, a widely worshiped deity of birth, renewal, health, and the dawn. Dawnbringers are especially vigilant foes of the undead, which they see as a plague upon the living, corrupting the life that is the gift of Lathander. They look to cleanse the world with Lathander's light, eradicating any undead with its purifying rays.

Advantages:
- Turns undead as a cleric four levels higher than their current level.
- Can cast Boon of Lathander as a special ability once per day. The Dawnbringer gains an additional use at levels 4, 8, 12, 16 and 20.
BOON OF LATHANDER: This spell lasts 1 round per level of the caster. It gives the caster a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls, a +1 bonus to all Saving Throws, and 1 extra attack per round. It also protects the caster from level drain.
- Can cast False Dawn as a special ability once per day at 9th level. The Dawnbringer gains an additional use at levels 20 and 30. The ability functions as the cleric spell of the same name.

Restrictions:
- Alignment: Any good, or lawful neutral.
- Multiclass: Fighter/Clerics, and Fighter/Mage/Clerics can all be Dawnbringers.

@20104 = ~Hold Undead
(Necromancy)

Range: 35 ft.
Duration: 2 rounds/level
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 1 creature and any enemies within 10 ft.
Saving Throw: Neg.

This spell holds 1d4 undead creatures rigidly immobile and in place for 12 or more rounds. The effect is centered on the victim selected by the caster. Any enemies within 10 ft. of the target are also affected. Those who succeed on their Saving Throws are totally unaffected by the spell. Held creatures cannot move or speak, but they remain aware of events around them and can use abilities not requiring motion or speech. Being held does not prevent the worsening of the subject's condition due to wounds.
~
@20105 = ~False Dawn
Range: 0
Duration: 5 rounds
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: 30-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None

False Dawn calls into existence a bright reddish light, as if a sunrise were occurring, within the area of effect. All undead creatures within the area suffer 6d6 points of fire damage and are blinded on the round after the false dawn appears. There is no Saving Throw.

@20202 = ~Hand of Torm~
@20203 = ~HAND OF TORM: Hands seek to emulate their deity Torm, who is known for his steadfast loyalty and dedication to all that is good.  While a great many of his worshipers are Champions (known as Paladins or Holy Champions of Torm), as Torm is the patron of Paladinhood, Hands are no less fierce and loyal to the cause of their god (if slightly less martial).

Advantages:
- Hands are special among clerics in that they gain focus in the protection sphere.
- Hands can cast Command as a spell like ability once per day.  <PRO_HESHE> can use this ability an additional time at levels 5, 10, 15, and 20.
- Hands are able to gain proficiency in any weapon or fighting style.  They can gain 2 pips in sword and shield fighting style.
- At 3rd level, a hand can cast detect evil as a spell like ability, once per day.  They gain an additional use of this ability at levels 7, 10, 13, 16 and 19.
- At 4th level, a hand can cast protection from evil as a spell like ability once per day.  They can use this ability an additional time at levels 8, 12, 16 and 20.

Restrictions:
- Alignment: Lawful good, lawful neutral, or neutral good only.
- Multiclass: Fighter/Clerics can be Hands of Torm.

@20501  = ~cleric of tymora~
@20502  = ~Luckrider of Tymora~
@20503  = ~LUCKRIDER OF TYMORA: Also known as Lady Luck, Tymora is the goddess of good fortune. The sect of her clerics known as Luckriders eat, drink, and sleep luck. Confident to the point of cockiness, they enter battle recklessly, throwing caution to the wind and trusting in fate. Considering how many adventurers perish despite crafting meticulous strategies and plans, this is not a ridiculous position.
 
Advantages:
- Luckriders are innately lucky, receiving the effects of the Luck spell permanently.
- May cast an area-of-effect "Tymora's Luck" spell innately once per day, and once more for each 5 levels of experience gained.

TYMORA'S LUCK:

The allies of this spellcaster gain extraordinary luck for the next 1 turn, receiving a +1 bonus to their saving throws, attack rolls, and minimum damage/healing rolls as well as +5% to all thieving skills. Furthermore, damage dice for all effects outside a weapon's base damage is reduced by 1. Finally, spells that offer saving throws to enemies are more likely to be effective: a spell that usually offers a saving throw with no penalty will instead offer a saving throw with a -2 penalty.

Restrictions:
- Alignment: may not Lawful or Evil.
- Multiclass: Cleric/Thieves can be Luckriders

// ... cleric of helm:
//
@20801 = ~cleric of helm~
@20802 = ~Watcher of Helm~
@20803 = ~WATCHER OF HELM: Like their deity, Watchers of Helm are stern, dedicated, and loyal, perhaps to a fault.  Helm teaches that the right path is not always obvious, but the surest way to the right path is through the execution of duty.  As such, watchers of helm strive to do what they must despite the consequences, to themselves or even to others.  While othes may suggest that this supposed 'dedication' is nothing more than a fetish, the watcher has no time for such nonsense. They do not have the idle time to question; it is their duty to be ever alert for possible threats to cosmic order.   
Advantages:
- Watchers automatically gain a proficiency point in bastard , Helm's favored weapon.  Fighter clerics do not get this bonus, but they are able to gain mastery with the bastard sword.
- Heightened Awareness: +1 bonus to AC and +2 bonus to save vs breath
- Can cast Helm's eye as a special ability once per day at 9th level.  The watcher gains an additional use at levels 11, 13, 15, 17 and 19. Helm's eye is equivalent to the wizard spell, wizard eye.
- Can cast Seeking Sword as a special ability once per day.  The Watcher gains an additional use at levels 4, 8, 12, 16 and 20.

SEEKING SWORD: This spell creates a sword in the Cleric's hand that cannot be dropped or unequipped. The sword is enchanted as a +4 weapon and provides a +4 THAC0 bonus, but no damage bonus. It deals 2d4 damage to any target it hits. The weapon sets the Cleric's number of attacks per round to 3 and lasts for 1 round per level. While it is equipped, the wielder cannot cast further spells.

Restrictions:
- Alignment: May be Lawful Good, Lawful Neutral, or True Neutral.
~
@20805  = ~~
@20806 = ~Helm's Eye~
@20807 = ~Helm's Eye

Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is employed, the priest creates an invisible sensory organ that sends him visual information. Helm's Eye can see with normal vision up to 60 ft. away in brightly lit areas, and can travel in any direction as long as the spell lasts. It has substance and a form that can be detected (by a Detect Invisibility spell, for instance). Solid barriers prevent the passage of Helm's Eye. The powers of the eye cannot be enhanced by other spells or items. The caster is subject to any gaze attack met by the eye. A successful Dispel Magic spell cast on the wizard or the eye ends the spell.

// ... cleric of KELEMVOR:
//
@20901 = ~cleric of kelemvor~
@20902 = ~Doomguide of Kelemvor~
@20903 = ~DOOMGUIDE OF KELEMVOR: Kelemvor is the most recent god of death.  He has proven to be quite different from Mykrul, the former god of death.  In particular, while the latter encouraged the creation of undead monstrosities, Kelevmor charges his clergy to actively destroy undead, seeing their existance as an unnatural perversion of the order of life and death.  As such, his clergy have become particularly talented undead slayers.

Advantages:
- Doomguides turn undead at 4 levels higher than a cleric of their level.
- +4 to saves against death
- At 7th level, the doomguide is protected as if with the Death Ward spell.  
- At 11th level, the doomguide is protected as if with the Negative Plane Protection spell.

Restrictions:
- Alignment: May not be evil or chaotic.
- Multiclass: Cleric/Fighters, and Cleric/Mages can be Doomguides.~
//
// ... cleric of tempus:
//
@21001 = ~cleric of tempus~
@21002 = ~Battleguard of Tempus~
@21003 = ~BATTLEGUARD OF TEMPUS:  Tempus, also known as the Lord of Battles or the Foehammer, is random in his favors, yet his chaotic nature favors all sides equally. Lord Tempus may be on an army's side one day and against them the next; such is the nature of war. Tempuran clergy can be found on both sides of a conflict, as none can ever truly know whom the war god will favor.

Advantages:
- Battleguards can be proficient with any weapon
- Battleguards gain a +1 bonus to damage with any melee weapon.
- Incite Rage: Battleguards can incite a berserker rage beginning at level 5, and again at levels 10, 15 and 20.  This ability is like the berserkers enrage, except that <PRO_HESHE> can incite this rage in <PRO_HIMHER>self or in others.

Restrictions:
- Alignment: No alignment restrictions.
- Multiclass: Cleric/Fighters can be Battleguards
~
@21004 = ~Incite Rage~
@21005 = ~~
@21006 = ~Incite Rage

The character can incite range in <PRO_HIMHER>self or another. While enraged, the character gains a bonus of +2 to <PRO_HISHER> attack and damage rolls as well as to <PRO_HISHER> Armor Class, and becomes immune to charm, confusion, fear, feeblemind, hold, imprisonment, level drain, maze, stun, and sleep. The character also gains 15 temporary Hit Points, which are taken away at the end of the berserk spree (possibly knocking the character unconscious).

After the effects end, the character becomes winded, suffering a -2 penalty to Armor Class, to-hit rolls, and damage rolls.~

// ... cleric of leira:

@21203  = ~MISTWALKER OF LEIRA: Leira is the goddess of deception and illusion. She was supposedly slain under mysterious circumstances during the Avatar crisis, but at least one sect of her worshippers, the Mistwalkers, continue to receive divine power. Lies are their currency, illusion is their tool.
 
Advantages:
- May use the "Leira's Double" ability once every 5 rounds. Often used in emergencies, this causes an illusionary double of the cleric to spring into existence. If the cleric is being attacked, the double will absorb the first blow that lands, and disappear. At 6th level two doubles are created, and at 12th level one of the two doubles can actually wander away from the cleric to distract enemies. Mistwalkers may use this ability once per turn.

Restrictions:
- May not dual-class to fighter.
- Alignment: may not be Lawful.

SHADOWSTEP: 
The character steps into the Shadow Plane and may move for 7 seconds while others are frozen in time. The caster cannot attack or cast spells while in the Shadow Plane.

Restrictions:

@45303 = ~SORCERER/THIEF: Sorcerers are practitioners of magic who were born with the innate ability to cast spells. It is thought that the blood of some powerful creature flows through their veins; perhaps they are the spawn of the gods themselves, or even dragons walking in humanoid form. Regardless, the Sorcerer's magic is intuitive rather than logical. They know fewer spells than Mages, and acquire spells more slowly, but they can cast spells more often and have no need to select and prepare spells ahead of time.

Advantages:
- May cast arcane spells.
- Sorcerers do not scribe and memorize spells as Mages do. Instead, they learn a small number of spells at each level, and can cast any of those spells without memorization.

Disadvantages:
- May not wear any armor.
- May only use the following weapons: dagger, quarterstaff, dart, sling.
- May only become Proficient (one slot) in any weapon class.
- May not place any slots in any fighting style.
- Hit Die: d4

@46403  = ~ABJURIST OF MYSTRA: Mystra is known as the Lady of Spells and the Mother of Magic. She tends to the Weave, which enables mortals to cast spells. One sect of Mystra's clerics, known as Abjurists, can channel the Weave into protective shields, making them excellent spell duelists.

Advantages:
- When an Abjurist casts Spell Deflection, Spell Turning, or Spell Trap spells, <PRO_HESHE> automatically gets the benefit of a Spell Shield as well. Every Abjurist automatically has these spells in <PRO_HISHER> wizard spellbook.
- One With the Weave: Abjurists can cast spells slightly more easily than most priests, gaining a -1 bonus to casting time.

Advantages:
- Monitors gain a bonus to their effective caster level, making them as effective as single-class spellcasterscasters with equivalent experience (+1 caster level per 5 levels).

@46602  = ~Spellbender~
@46603  = ~SPELLBENDER: The goddess Mystra rules all magic, and mandates that spellcasters must formulate known spells, and must memorize the patterns of those spells in order to successfully release them. But as with any system, the are gaps and shortcuts that may be used to circumvent the rules. Sorcerers are born with the ability to shape magic directly, though only into a limited number of effects; and wild mages shape spells without discipline, achieving powerful results at the risk of disastrous side-effects. Spellbenders make a science of mapping the ways to bypass Mystra's restrictions. Practicing as generalist clerics as well as studying arcane wizardry, they learn to manipulate the intersection of those two areas of magic.

Advantages:
- May use the 'Arcane Weaving' ability in place of memorizing priest spells. This ability allows the Spellbender to spontaneously cast one of several wizard spells of one level lower than the sacrificed priest spell.
- May use the 'Divine Weaving' ability in place of memorizing wizard spells. This ability allows the Spellbender to spontaneously cast one of several priest spells of one level lower than the sacrificed wizard spell.

Restrictions:
- None.

<PRO_HISHER> body becomes incredibly resistant to damage.  <PRO_HEHER> AC is set at 0, and <PRO_HESHE> is 50% resistant to all physical damage.  <PRO_HESHE> also becomes completely immune to fire and electricity, and only suffers half damage from cold.  Additionally, <PRO_HESHE> regenerates 6 hit points per round.

Additionally, <PRO_HESHE> is infused with the raw power of nature, gaining a strength of 20, and <PRO_HESHE> can make two unarmed attacks per round inflicting 2d8 (+8 from strength) damage, and those struck must make a save vs. breath or be entangled for two rounds.

These unarmed attacks count as +3 weapons.

<PRO_HESHE> loses the ability to cast spells while transformed.~

@70001  = ~mystic~
@70002  = ~Mystic~
@70003  = ~MYSTICS: Through study and meditation, Mystics form a spiritual connection with some aspect of the natural world, and channel energy through that connection to create magical effects. This art has been practiced in some fashion since the dawn of time, before there were religions or deities; some say Mystics are the original magic-users. 

PURE MYSTICS form a deep, spiritual connection with a fundamental aspect of the universe: one of the prime elements, or light or shadow. The magic that flows through them is raw and powerful, but their ability to shape it is limited to effects closely related to their focus. Some say Mystics are all blessed by Mystra, as practitioners of the purest form of magic. The goddess herself has not deigned to comment on such claims.

DRUIDS are a branch of Mystics focused on the balanced combinations of elemental energies that result in living ecosystems. At the direction of the deities Sylvanus and Chauntea, they have organized themselves into ordered hierarchies in which to teach and practice their abilities. They have mastery over all facets of the natural world.  Some are generalists, while others focus on a particular habitat or aspect of nature.

OCCULTISTS learn to tap magical power in nontraditional ways. Through study and (often) unnatural experiments, they can learn to harness the boiling energies of the inner planes, or infernal powers from the outer planes, or the wild, animal nature seething inside every man and woman. Some have even learned to steal magical energy from the deities themselves - calling into question whether those beings are truly omnipotent.

All of these classes share some common attributes. Creating and maintaining the spiritual connections to perform this type of magic is very demanding. Therefore, they may not spare the time to master the use of complicated or martial weapons; they are excluded from using 2-handed swords, halberds, katanas, bastard swords, long swords, flails, morning stars, maces, and crossbows.

Most Druids now consider Nature Mystics to be heretics, practicing a dangerous and less refined version of their art.

Advantages:

// ... avenger => hivekeeper:
//
@73401  = ~hivekeeper~
@73402  = ~Hivekeeper~
@73403  = ~HIVEKEEPER: these druids maintain an interest in and affection for insectoid, arachnid, and similar animals. Such fauna play an integral role in the natural ecosystems which druids protect and revere, but they are often overlooked or even reviled by humanoids. Hivekeepers recognize and promote the productive capabilities of these animals; and they also learn utilize the potent natural weaponry that these animals have developed. Hivekeepers are often treated with some discomfort by others, and are therefore often loners. But no druids can deny their effectiveness when called up to oppose nature's enemies.

@73501  = ~northern druid~
@73502  = ~Northern Druid~
@73503  = ~NORTHERN DRUID: Even in the frozen tundra and on windswept mountains, life persists. Arctic druids revel in the harsh but balanced wilds in which the cold is every creature's most dangerous predator. They revel in arctic storms and learn to manipulate the forces of water and air. Through seclusion and training, they learn the importance of perseverance and determination in the face of privation and seeming hopelessness, and harness the strengths of animals that develop such perserverance naturally. This makes northern druids quite dangerous foes to those who would offend nature in the frozen north.

@73901  = ~lost druid~
@73902  = ~Lost Druid~
@73903  = ~LOST DRUID: Lost druids find that many other druids no longer consider them kin. Stricken by death in some traumatic way, these brooding individuals have a near-obsessive interest in the role of death in the cycles of life. They even take this as far as reanimating animal corpses and embracing necromantic magic in order to seek vengeance. This makes Lost Druids particularly dangerous, shunned by nearly everyone.

Advantages:
- At 1st level, may summon a Dread Wolf. This ability summons two dread wolves at 7th level, and three at 10th level.
- At 5th level, may shapeshift into the form of a dread wolf.

@74102  = ~Druid of Silvanus~
@74103  = ~DRUID OF SILVANUS: Most druids reside in the regions where soil is nutritious, plant life is abundant and animals thrive.  These regions are in many ways the epitome of harmonious ecosystems, and druids often charge themselves with nurturing and defending them.  Tall forests are a paradise in many ways: they provide shade from the sun, food and homes for animals and people, and wood for tools.  Forests are incessantly under threat of being torn down and subjugated by careless humans and demihumans. Forest druids therefore often live with a constant low-grade paranoia, which informs the stereotype of druids being hostile to civilization.

Advantages:
- At 1st level, may summon a Spirit Bear. The HD of the spirit animal increases to match the druid's level at 3rd, 5th, 7th and 10th level.
- At 3rd level, may shapeshift into the form of a wolf or a ferret at will.

WOLF: in wolf form the druid can detect hidden enemies. He can attack 1.5 times per round for 2d4 piercing damage. Successful attacks have a chance to grapple the target, briefly Slowing them; they must make a saving throw to avoid this.

BLACK BEAR: in black bear form, the druid has 19 strength. <PRO_HESHE> can attack twice per round with claws that cause 2d6 slashing damage.

WYVERN: in wyvern form the druid can fly over ground-based obstacles like Entangle and Web spells. <PRO_HISHER> powerful claws can rake victims for 2d6 damage and <PRO_HISHER> attacks can poison the target with similar effects to the Assassin's "Poison Weapon" ability. Additionally, the druid can create a powerful gust of wind that acts like a smaller version of a dragon's "Wing Buffet" ability.~

@76203  = ~BEAST LORD: these individuals have come to understand that within even the most rational and civilized man or woman lies an animal driven by primal needs and desires. (Often, this understanding is developed from horrifying experiments performed on subjects who are very rarely willing.) Through the application of a serum derived from a strain of lycanthropy, the Beast Lord can call forth <PRO_HISHER> own bestial nature, causing <PRO_HISHER> very body to take on lupine qualities. This also gives the Beast Lord a deep insight into magic relating to summoning and controlling animals.

Advantages:
- May cast "Beast Claw" as an innate ability, at will.
- 20% of all Beast Claw attacks cause infection upon a failed save vs. Death, weakening the target and causing a 10% chance of spell failure.

They have a deeper understanding than most of how the basic elements combine and interact to form the complex materials and energies common in the Prime Material Plane. This allows them to tease them apart and focus their magic on just one element at a time, resulting in purer and more powerful effects relating to that element.

Advantages:
- May cast one extra spell per level
- May control any elemental, at will (control lasts 1 turn)
- Once per day, may choose an "element of focus." This gives the Elementalist 15% resistance to damage from that element, and causes 15% extra damage from any spells using that damage type. These effects increase to 25% at 15th level, and 35% at 20th level.

The damage types relating to each element are as follows:
- Air = lightning damage
- Earth = crushing damage

They indulge and encourage chaos wherever they go, and there must be something to their actions, because by some unknown mechanism, they are granted access to powerful magic. The magic is fickle though, suffering the same uncertainty that plagues Wild Mages. Scholars debate whether their magic is granted by a manipulative deity, or whether they have possibly hit upon some deep structural secret of the multiverse. Whatever the truth, most people view these Occultists with fear and wariness.

Advantages:
- A Chaos Priest's spellcasting is affected by wild magic. With every spell cast, there is a chance for a Wild Surge to occur.
- Chaos Priests may cast Wild Magic spells, including Reckless Dweomer and Chaos Shield.

@90001  = ~ranger~
@90002  = ~Ranger~
@90003  = ~RANGERS: The general term 'Ranger' includes several varieties of hardy warriors which share certain characteristics: they are strong fighters, and they are skilled in stealth and scouting. In battle, rangers favor quickness and skill over brute force. They often use light, single-handed weapons, and are adept and wielding a weapon in each hand simultaneously.

SCOUTS are warriors who may not be particularly spiritual, but tend to share certain values and combat tactics with Rangers. They have very little magical abilities - generally only a couple spells connected to their particular abilities. Instead they develop skills through sheer determination, learning techniques and abilities that help them survive.

"TRUE RANGERS" are masters of their local geography, learning skills that allow them to survive in the harsh wilderness where few others could. They have access to spheres of magic relating to the environment in which they specialize, similar to druids. Rangers are generally good-natured and protective of their fellow men, using their skills to support and provide for communities in wild frontiers.

This spell holds 1 hostile animal rigidly immobile if it fails to save vs. Spell. Only normal and giant-sized animals are affected by this spell. Strange monsters such as wyverns and carrion crawlers do not count as animals.

Paralyzed creatures are helpless and cannot dodge or defend themselves from attacks. Being held does not prevent the worsening of the subject's condition due to wounds, disease, or poison.~
