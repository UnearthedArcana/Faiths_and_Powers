CLASS FEATURES:

- Deity Selection: All clerics must select a deity.  Deity selection determines sphere access, granted powers, and other bonuses.
- May become Proficient (one slot) with the short sword, Dagger, War Hammer, Club, Spear, Flail, Mace, Quarterstaff, Crossbow, Dart, Sling, or any fighting style.

@10101 = ~incarnate~
@10102 = ~Incarnate~
@10103 = ~INCARNATE: Often called, "Chosen", Incarnates are 'natural' priests, with little or no connection to any church hierarchy. It is less true to say that they choose their deity than they are 'chosen' by a given deity (whether they like it or not) for their temperament, and natural connection to divine magic. Often peasants, they typically have few skills or other special training.

Advantages:
- Divine Favor: Incarnates gain special unique abilities that are not available to other clerics, including specialized priests of the same deity.

Disadvantages:
- Is not proficient with armor, shields or helmets.~

@10104 = ~priest~
@10105 = ~Priest~

CLASS FEATURES:

- Devoted Servant: Priests always get more bonus spells than other clerics of the same deity as the have spent years cultivating a connection with that deity through rigorous ritual and meditation. As such, they gain +1 spell per spell level.
- Sphere Focus: Priests gain access to spells earlier than other priests.  They gain access to spells one level earlier to their deity's favored sphere.

Disadvantages:
- Can only wear leather armors
- Gains only d6 HD per level.

@20001 = ~ur-priest~

@20003 = ~UR-PRIEST: Ur-Priests are heretical practitioners that have found a way to wrest divine power from the gods with the use of ancient and forbidden rituals.  As might be expected, this behavior is frowned upon by the gods, and Ur-Priests have to keep their profession secret or risk persecution or worse.

Advantages:
- Sphere Access: Very high access.  The Ur-Priest gains major access to all spheres except the life, benediction, plant, animal and light spheres.
- Sap the Spirit: Ur-Priests can use the same techniques to drain living beings of their divine essence in much the same way they do so from the gods; though, of course, mortals do not have much of a divine essence, and so the benefits of this ability are limited.
This ability can be used once per day at fifth level.  The Ur-Priest can use Sap the Spirit an additional time per day at levels 10, 15 and 20.

SAP THE SPIRIT: This ability deals 1d4 magic damage to a living target per 4 levels of the Ur-Priest (2d4 at 5th level; maximum 6d4 at 20th level).
Beginning at 5th level, if the Ur-Priest kills a target with this ability, <PRO_HESHE> casts priest spells at +1 level for 5 rounds.  
At 10th level, if the Ur-Priest kills a target with this ability, <PRO_HESHE> also gains the benefits of the spell, Wondrous Recall.

Disadvantages:
- Cannot Turn Undead
- The rituals tax the Ur-Priest, making them more vulnerable to the effects of disease and magic.  They gain a -2 penalty to save vs. death and spells.

Deity access: None, despises the gods.

Restrictions: Cannot be of a good or lawful alignment~

@20004 = ~Sap the Spirit~

@20101 = ~dawnbringer of lathander~
@20102 = ~Dawnbringer of Lathander~
@20103 = ~DAWNBRINGER OF LATHANDER: Dawnbringers are the representatives of Lathander, a widely worshiped deity of birth, renewal, health, and the dawn. Dawnbringers are especially vigilant foes of the undead, which they see as a plague upon the living, corrupting the life that is the gift of Lathander. They look to cleanse the world with Lathander's light, eradicating any undead with its purifying rays.

Advantages:
- Turns undead as a cleric four levels higher than their current level.
- Can cast Boon of Lathander as a special ability once per day. The Dawnbringer gains an additional use at levels 4, 8, 12, 16 and 20.

BOON OF LATHANDER: This spell lasts 1 round per level of the caster. It gives the caster a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls, a +1 bonus to all Saving Throws, and 1 extra attack per round. It also protects the caster from level drain.

- Can cast False Dawn as a special ability once per day at 9th level. The Dawnbringer gains an additional use at levels 20 and 30. The ability functions as the cleric spell of the same name.

Restrictions:
- Alignment: Any good, or lawful neutral.

@20104 = ~Hold Undead
(Necromancy)

Range: 35 ft.
Duration: 2 rounds/level
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 1 creature and any enemies within 10 ft.
Saving Throw: Neg.

This spell holds 1d4 undead creatures rigidly immobile and in place for 12 or more rounds. The effect is centered on the victim selected by the caster. Any enemies within 10 ft. of the target are also affected. Those who succeed on their Saving Throws are totally unaffected by the spell. Held creatures cannot move or speak, but they remain aware of events around them and can use abilities not requiring motion or speech. Being held does not prevent the worsening of the subject's condition due to wounds.
~
@20105 = ~False Dawn
Range: 0
Duration: 5 rounds
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: 30-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None

False Dawn calls into existence a bright reddish light, as if a sunrise were occurring, within the area of effect. All undead creatures within the area suffer 6d6 points of fire damage and are blinded on the round after the false dawn appears. There is no Saving Throw.

@20203 = ~HAND OF TORM: Hands seek to emulate their deity Torm, who is known for his steadfast loyalty and dedication to all that is good.  While a great many of his worshipers are Champions (known as Paladins or Holy Champions of Torm), as Torm is the patron of Paladinhood, Hands are no less fierce and loyal to the cause of their god (if slightly less martial).

Advantages:
- Hands are special among clerics in that they gain focus in the protection sphere.
- Hands can cast Command as a spell like ability once per day.  <PRO_HESHE> can use this ability an additional time at levels 5, 10, 15, and 20.
- Hands are able to gain proficiency in any weapon or fighting style.  They can gain 2 pips in sword and shield fighting style.
- At 3rd level, a hand can cast detect evil as a spell like ability, once per day.  They gain an additional use of this ability at levels 7, 10, 13, 16 and 19.
- At 4th level, a hand can cast protection from evil as a spell like ability once per day.  They can use this ability an additional time at levels 8, 12, 16 and 20.

Restrictions:
- Alignment: Lawful good, lawful neutral, or neutral good only.

Confident to the point of cockiness, they enter battle recklessly, throwing caution to the wind and trusting in fate. Considering how many adventurers perish despite crafting meticulous strategies and plans, this is not a ridiculous position.
 
Advantages:
- Luckriders are innately lucky, receiving the effects of the Luck spell permanently.
- May cast an area-of-effect "Tymora's Luck" spell innately once per day, and once more for each 5 levels of experience gained.

TYMORA'S LUCK: The allies of this spellcaster gain extraordinary luck for the next 1 turn, receiving a +1 bonus to their saving throws, attack rolls, and minimum damage/healing rolls as well as +5% to all thieving skills. Furthermore, damage dice for all effects outside a weapon's base damage is reduced by 1. Finally, spells that offer saving throws to enemies are more likely to be effective: a spell that usually offers a saving throw with no penalty will instead offer a saving throw with a -2 penalty.

Restrictions:
- Alignment: may not Lawful or Evil.

@20801 = ~watcher of helm~
@20802 = ~Watcher of Helm~
@20803 = ~WATCHER OF HELM: Like their deity, Watchers of Helm are stern, dedicated, and loyal, perhaps to a fault.  Helm teaches that the right path is not always obvious, but the surest way to the right path is through the execution of duty.  As such, watchers of helm strive to do what they must despite the consequences, to themselves or even to others.  While othes may suggest that this supposed 'dedication' is nothing more than a fetish, the watcher has no time for such nonsense. They do not have the idle time to question; it is their duty to be ever alert for possible threats to cosmic order.   

Advantages:
- Watchers automatically gain a proficiency point in bastard , Helm's favored weapon.  Fighter clerics do not get this bonus, but they are able to gain mastery with the bastard sword.
- Heightened Awareness: +1 bonus to AC and +2 bonus to save vs breath
- Can cast Helm's eye as a special ability once per day at 9th level.  The watcher gains an additional use at levels 11, 13, 15, 17 and 19. Helm's eye is equivalent to the wizard spell, wizard eye.
- Can cast Seeking Sword as a special ability once per day.  The Watcher gains an additional use at levels 4, 8, 12, 16 and 20.

SEEKING SWORD: This spell creates a sword in the Cleric's hand that cannot be dropped or unequipped. The sword is enchanted as a +4 weapon and provides a +4 THAC0 bonus, but no damage bonus. It deals 2d4 damage to any target it hits. The weapon sets the Cleric's number of attacks per round to 3 and lasts for 1 round per level. While it is equipped, the wielder cannot cast further spells.

Restrictions:
- Alignment: May be Lawful Good, Lawful Neutral, or True Neutral.

Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is employed, the priest creates an invisible sensory organ that sends him visual information. Helm's Eye can see with normal vision up to 60 ft. away in brightly lit areas, and can travel in any direction as long as the spell lasts. It has substance and a form that can be detected (by a Detect Invisibility spell, for instance). Solid barriers prevent the passage of Helm's Eye. The powers of the eye cannot be enhanced by other spells or items. The caster is subject to any gaze attack met by the eye. A successful Dispel Magic spell cast on the wizard or the eye ends the spell.

@20901 = ~doomguide of kelemvor~
@20902 = ~Doomguide of Kelemvor~
@20903 = ~DOOMGUIDE OF KELEMVOR: Kelemvor is the most recent god of death.  He has proven to be quite different from Mykrul, the former god of death.  In particular, while the latter encouraged the creation of undead monstrosities, Kelevmor charges his clergy to actively destroy undead, seeing their existance as an unnatural perversion of the order of life and death.  As such, his clergy have become particularly talented undead slayers.

Advantages:
- Doomguides turn undead at 4 levels higher than a cleric of their level.
- +4 to saves against death
- At 7th level, the doomguide is protected as if with the Death Ward spell.

@21002 = ~Battleguard of Tempus~
@21003 = ~BATTLEGUARD OF TEMPUS:  Tempus, also known as the Lord of Battles or the Foehammer, is random in his favors, yet his chaotic nature favors all sides equally. Lord Tempus may be on an army's side one day and against them the next; such is the nature of war. Tempuran clergy can be found on both sides of a conflict, as none can ever truly know whom the war god will favor.

Advantages:
- Battleguards can be proficient with any weapon
- Battleguards gain a +1 bonus to damage with any melee weapon.
- Incite Rage: Battleguards can incite a berserker rage beginning at level 5, and again at levels 10, 15 and 20.  This ability is like the berserkers enrage, except that <PRO_HESHE> can incite this rage in <PRO_HIMHER>self or in others.

The character also gains 15 temporary Hit Points, which are taken away at the end of the berserk spree (possibly knocking the character unconscious).

After the effects end, the character becomes winded, suffering a -2 penalty to Armor Class, to-hit rolls, and damage rolls.~

@21203  = ~MISTWALKER OF LEIRA: Leira is the goddess of deception and illusion. She was supposedly slain under mysterious circumstances during the Avatar crisis, but at least one sect of her worshippers, the Mistwalkers, continue to receive divine power. Lies are their currency, illusion is their tool.
 
Advantages:
- May use the "Leira's Double" ability once every 5 rounds. Often used in emergencies, this causes an illusionary double of the cleric to spring into existence. If the cleric is being attacked, the double will absorb the first blow that lands, and disappear. At 6th level two doubles are created, and at 12th level one of the two doubles can actually wander away from the cleric to distract enemies. Mistwalkers may use this ability once per turn.

Restrictions:

@21903  = ~PAINGIVER OF LOVIATAR: Known as The Maiden of Pain and The Willing Whip, loviatar is the evil goddess of agony. She is often seen as a cold-hearted bully, calculating and despotic; she revels in inflicting physical and psychological suffering. Her priests, known simply as "Paingivers" find freedom and power in such pain, and they seek to spread that gospel to others... regardless whether their victims are actually seeking such enlightenment.

Advantages:
- Can use the Pain Touch ability at will.

PAIN TOUCH: When the priest of Lovitar activates this ability, her mere touch creates waves of pain for any creature with a nervous system.  When she touches any creature, they must save vs death or suffer a -2 penalty to their dexterity and -4 to thac0 as they writhe in agony and will suffer 1 point of non-lethal damage every 12 seconds.
The penalties and damage occurs over an excruciating period of 10 rounds.
Pain touch remains activated indefinitely, but the Paingiver may suppress it as needed.

- At 3rd level, Paingivers can use Loviatar's Caress once per day.  <PRO_HESHE> can use this ability one more time at levels 6, 9, 12, 15 and 18.

LOVIATAR'S CARESS:

When the cleric uses this ability, <PRO_HISHER> hands become instruments of Lovitar for four rounds.  <PRO_HESHE> can strike with uncanny accuracy with <PRO_HISHER> hands (+10 to hit) and <PRO_HESHE> inflicts an additional +2 points of damage per level to a maximum of +20 points at 10th level.  This spell stacks with other unarmed attacks, such as the priest's pain touch.

@22401 = ~stormbringer of talos~
@22402 = ~Stormbringer of Talos~
@22403 = ~STORMBRINGER OF TALOS: Stormbringers are clerics of Talos, the Destroyer, the Raging One, the Stormstar, the Storm Lord.  Talos is the dark side of nature, the uncaring and destructive force that lies waiting to strike at any time.  Stormbringers strive to make all fear Talos by showing the destruction that he and all his servants can cause.  As examples to all, Stormbringers tend to indulge in acts of random or spiteful destruction as they travel and to make examples of all folk who stand up to them.

Advantages:
- Talos' Favor: Stormbringers are 50% resistant to electricity damage.
- Can cast Storm Shield as a special ablity once per day.  The Stormbringer gains an additional use at levels 4, 8, 12, 16 and 20.

@22002 = ~Scion of Bhaal~
@22003 = ~SCION OF BHAAL: It is said that before Bhaal was killed by Cyric during the Timme of Troubles, he foresaw his own demise and took steps to circumvent it. After all the power of a god - especially the god of death - does not fade away so quickly. While many Bhaalist priests lose their access to magic, it is said that some individuals have managed to hold on to a portion of his power. Whether this is through worship - as some priest of other missing deities like Leira have continued to receive blessings - or some other mechanism, is unknown. As to what might be done with such power and where it may lead, that too is unknown.

Advantages:
- At 3rd level, Scions of Bhaal may cast Horror as an innate ability once per day.

Like many evil gods, she is more often feared than revered, though there are notable exceptions.

When a Seeker demonstrates solid service or true loyalty in Oghma's cause, <PRO_HESHE> is bestowed with the title of Loremaster. This is a great honor; while outsiders may perceive the god of sages as belonging in dusty libraries, the fact is that many Oghmanite priests are of an adventuresome bent.

Thus, a 10th-level Fighter could be charmed, but an ogre could not. The person receives a Save vs. Spell -2 to avoid the effect.

If the spell recipient fails <PRO_HISHER> Save vs. Spell, <PRO_HESHE> regards the caster as a trusted friend and ally to be heeded and protected. The caster can give <PRO_HIMHER> orders, and the charmed individual will carry them out as quickly as possible.

If the caster harms, or attempts to harm, the charmed person by some overt action, or if Dispel Magic is successfully cast upon the charmed person, the charm spell is broken.

These regions are in many ways the epitome of harmonious ecosystems, and druids often charge themselves with nurturing and defending them.  Tall forests are a paradise in many ways: they provide shade from the sun, food and homes for animals and people, and wood for tools.  Forests are incessantly under threat of being torn down and subjugated by careless humans and demihumans. Forest druids therefore often live with a constant low-grade paranoia, which informs the stereotype of druids being hostile to civilization.

But as with any system, the are gaps and shortcuts that may be used to circumvent the rules. Sorcerers are born with the ability to shape magic directly, though only into a limited number of effects; and wild mages shape spells without discipline, achieving powerful results at the risk of disastrous side-effects. Spellbenders make a science of mapping the ways to bypass Mystra's restrictions. Practicing as generalist clerics as well as studying arcane wizardry, they learn to manipulate the intersection of those two areas of magic.

Advantages:

@70003  = ~DRUIDS: Druids form a spiritual connection with an aspect of the natural world, and channel energy through that connection to create magical effects. This art has been practiced in some fashion since the dawn of time, some say since before there were religions or deities. Most druids are organized in ordered hierarchies in which to teach and practice their abilities. 

MYSTICS are a wild and independent sort of druid. They tend to remove themelves to remote places, in which they focus on meditating and connecting to one of the fundamental elements of the Prime Material Plane: earth, air, water, fire, light or darkness. The magic that flows through them is raw and powerful, but their ability to shape it is limited to effects closely related to their area of focus. Some people say Mystics are blessed by Mystra, as practitioners of the purest form of magic. The goddess herself has not given a comment on such claims.

OCCULTISTS learn to tap magical power of the universe in exotic, nontraditional ways. Through study and (often) unnatural experiments, they can learn to harness the boiling energies of the inner planes, or infernal powers from the outer planes, or the wild, animal nature seething inside every man and woman. Some have even learned to steal magical energy from the deities themselves - calling into question whether those beings are truly omnipotent.

CLASS FEATURES:

– May only wear non-metallic armor.
– May only equip bucklers and non-metallic shields.

Most Druids now consider Nature Mystics to be heretics, practicing a dangerous and less refined version of their art. Druids nevertheless respect the source of these Mystics' power, and in the rare case they cross paths, grudgingly allow Mystics to participate in their magic rituals.

Advantages:
- May cast one extra spell per level
- Casts spells as if one level of experience higher

- May cast a short, single-target Entanglement spell at will. This keeps the target from moving for one round and, on a failed save vs. Breath, Holds the target still and causes 1d4 points of piercing damage.

@71104  = ~FATE MYSTIC: fate is a very subtle force that runs throughout the multiverse. Everyone has a fate, from the lowliest insect to the most powerful deity. No one can escape their fate, but free-willed beings may direct its course. Recognition and understanding of this is what most cultures call "wisdom," but even they fail to understand just how magical and powerful an act it can be to exercise decisional control over oneself and one's environment. Fate Mystics are among the few who do not take this for granted. They are in tune with the themselves, their histories and their futures, and can use that to great tactical advantage.~

Upon using this ability, the Mystic is allowed to choose a spell from his repertoire of known spells. One spell level every 3 levels of the caster is allowed (rounded up), up to 7th-level spells at 19th level. Once the spell is chosen, the caster can choose a condition of some kind from the list provided, such as "an enemy being sighted." Once this starting condition is satisfied, the spell that was chosen will be cast. This requires no action by the wizard, but happens automatically and instantaneously.~

These regions are in many ways the epitome of harmonious ecosystems, and druids often charge themselves with nurturing and defending them.  Tall forests are a paradise in many ways: they provide shade from the sun, food and homes for animals and people, and wood for tools.  Forests are incessantly under threat of being torn down and subjugated by careless humans and demihumans. Forest druids therefore often live with a constant low-grade paranoia, which informs the stereotype of druids being hostile to civilization.

Advantages:
- At 1st level, may summon a Spirit Bear. The HD of the spirit animal increases to match the druid's level at 3rd, 5th, 7th and 10th level.
- At 3rd level, may shapeshift into the form of a wolf or a ferret at will.

Such fauna play an integral role in the natural ecosystems which druids protect and revere, but they are often overlooked or even reviled by humanoids. Hivekeepers recognize and promote the productive capabilities of these animals; and they also learn utilize the potent natural weaponry that these animals have developed. Hivekeepers are often treated with some discomfort by others, and are therefore often loners. But no druids can deny their effectiveness when called up to oppose nature's enemies.

Advantages:
- At 1st level, may summon a Spirit Spider. The HD of the spirit animal increases to match the druid's level at 3rd, 5th, 7th and 10th level.

@73503  = ~NORTHERN DRUID: Even in the frozen tundra and on windswept mountains, life persists. Arctic druids revel in the harsh but balanced wilds in which the cold is every creature's most dangerous predator. They revel in arctic storms and learn to manipulate the forces of water and air. Through seclusion and training, they learn the importance of perseverance and determination in the face of privation and seeming hopelessness, and harness the strengths of animals that develop such perserverance naturally. This makes northern druids quite dangerous foes to those who would offend nature in the frozen north.

@73903  = ~LOST DRUID: Lost druids find that many other druids no longer consider them kin. Stricken by death in some traumatic way, these brooding individuals have a near-obsessive interest in the role of death in the cycles of life. They even take this as far as reanimating animal corpses and embracing necromantic magic in order to seek vengeance. This makes Lost Druids particularly dangerous, shunned by nearly everyone.

Advantages:
- At 1st level, may summon a Dread Wolf. This ability summons two dread wolves at 7th level, and three at 10th level.
- At 5th level, may shapeshift into the form of a dread wolf.

This also gives the Beast Lord a deep insight into magic relating to summoning and controlling animals.

Advantages:

- 20% of all Beast Claw attacks cause infection upon a failed save vs. Death, weakening the target and causing a 10% chance of spell failure.

@90001  = ~ranger~
@90002  = ~Ranger~
@90003  = ~RANGERS: The general term 'Ranger' includes several varieties of hardy warriors which share certain characteristics: they are strong fighters, and they are skilled in stealth and scouting. In battle, rangers favor quickness and skill over brute force. They often use light, single-handed weapons, and are adept and wielding a weapon in each hand simultaneously.

SCOUTS are warriors who may not be particularly spiritual, but tend to share certain values and combat tactics with Rangers. They have very little magical abilities - generally only a couple spells connected to their particular abilities. Instead they develop skills through sheer determination, learning techniques and abilities that help them survive.

"TRUE RANGERS" are masters of their local geography, learning skills that allow them to survive in the harsh wilderness where few others could. They have access to spheres of magic relating to the environment in which they specialize, similar to druids. Rangers are generally good-natured and protective of their fellow men, using their skills to support and provide for communities in wild frontiers.
