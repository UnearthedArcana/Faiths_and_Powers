Though <PRO_HESHE> is both protector and healer, <PRO_HESHE> is not purely defensive-when enemies threaten, the Cleric is well suited to challenge them on their own ground and destroy them.

CLASS FEATURES:
- May wear helmets.
- May wear up to Chain Mail armor.
- Deity Selection: All clerics must select a deity.  Deity selection determines sphere access, granted powers, and other bonuses.
- May become Proficient (one slot) with the short sword, Dagger, War Hammer, Club, Spear, Flail, Mace, Quarterstaff, Crossbow, Dart, Sling, or any fighting style.
- May Turn Undead.

@10101 = ~incarnate~
@10102 = ~Incarnate~
@10103 = ~INCARNATE: Often called, "Chosen", Incarnates are 'natural' priests, with little or no connection to any church hierarchy. It is less true to say that they choose their deity than they are 'chosen' by a given deity (whether they like it or not) for their temperament, and natural connection to divine magic. Often peasants, they typically have few skills or other special training.

Advantages:
- Divine Favor: Incarnates gain special unique abilities that are not available to other clerics, including specialized priests of the same deity.
Disadvantages:
- Is not proficient with armor, shields or helmets.~

@10106 = ~ACOLYTE: Also known as "Archivists" or "Cloisters", Acolytes are especially pious and studious clerics that rarely venture beyond abbey walls. However, when they do go adventuring, their skills and spells are quite useful, even if they lack combat training typical of most clerics.

CLASS FEATURES:

- Devoted Servant: Acolytes always get more bonus spells than other clerics of the same deity as the have spent years cultivating a connection with that deity through rigorous ritual and meditation. As such, they gain +1 spell per spell level.
- Sphere Focus: Acolytes gain access to spells earlier than other priests.  They gain access to spells one level earlier to their deity's favored sphere.

Disadvantages:
- Can only wear leather armors
- Gains only d6 HD per level.

@20001 = ~ur-priest~
@20002 = ~Ur-Priest~
@20003 = ~UR-PRIEST: Ur-Priests are heretical practitioners that have found a way to wrest divine power from the gods with the use of ancient and forbidden rituals.  As might be expected, this behavior is frowned upon by the gods, and Ur-Priests have to keep their profession secret or risk persecution or worse.

Advantages:
- Sphere Access: Very high access.  The Ur-Priest gains major access to all spheres except the life, benediction, plant, animal and light spheres.
- Sap the Spirit: Ur-Priests can use the same techniques to drain living beings of their divine essence in much the same way they do so from the gods; though, of course, mortals do not have much of a divine essence, and so the benefits of this ability are limited.
This ability can be used once per day at fifth level.  The Ur-Priest can use Sap the Spirit an additional time per day at levels 10, 15 and 20.

SAP THE SPIRIT: This ability deals 1d4 magic damage to a living target per 4 levels of the Ur-Priest (2d4 at 5th level; maximum 6d4 at 20th level).
Beginning at 5th level, if the Ur-Priest kills a target with this ability, <PRO_HESHE> casts priest spells at +1 level for 5 rounds.  
At 10th level, if the Ur-Priest kills a target with this ability, <PRO_HESHE> also gains the benefits of the spell, Wondrous Recall.

Disadvantages:
- Cannot Turn Undead
- The rituals tax the Ur-Priest, making them more vulnerable to the effects of disease and magic.  They gain a -2 penalty to save vs. death and spells.

Deity access: None, despises the gods.

Restrictions: Cannot be of a good or lawful alignment~

@20101 = ~cleric of lathander~

@20103 = ~DAWNBRINGER OF LATHANDER: Dawnbringers are the representatives of Lathander, a widely worshiped deity of birth, renewal, health, and the dawn. Dawnbringers are especially vigilant foes of the undead, which they see as a plague upon the living, corrupting the life that is the gift of Lathander. They look to cleanse the world with Lathander's light, eradicating any undead with its purifying rays.

Advantages:
- Turns undead as a cleric four levels higher than their current level.
- Can cast Boon of Lathander as a special ability once per day. The Dawnbringer gains an additional use at levels 4, 8, 12, 16 and 20.
BOON OF LATHANDER: This spell lasts 1 round per level of the caster. It gives the caster a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls, a +1 bonus to all Saving Throws, and 1 extra attack per round. It also protects the caster from level drain.
- Can cast False Dawn as a special ability once per day at 9th level. The Dawnbringer gains an additional use at levels 20 and 30. The ability functions as the cleric spell of the same name.

Restrictions:
- Alignment: Any good, or lawful neutral.
- Multiclass: Fighter/Clerics, and Fighter/Mage/Clerics can all be Dawnbringers.

@20104 = ~Hold Undead
(Necromancy)

Range: 35 ft.
Duration: 2 rounds/level
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 1 creature and any enemies within 10 ft.
Saving Throw: Neg.

This spell holds 1d4 undead creatures rigidly immobile and in place for 12 or more rounds. The effect is centered on the victim selected by the caster. Any enemies within 10 ft. of the target are also affected. Those who succeed on their Saving Throws are totally unaffected by the spell. Held creatures cannot move or speak, but they remain aware of events around them and can use abilities not requiring motion or speech. Being held does not prevent the worsening of the subject's condition due to wounds.
~
@20105 = ~False Dawn
Range: 0
Duration: 5 rounds
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: 30-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None

False Dawn calls into existence a bright reddish light, as if a sunrise were occurring, within the area of effect. All undead creatures within the area suffer 6d6 points of fire damage and are blinded on the round after the false dawn appears. There is no Saving Throw.

@20203 = ~HAND OF TORM: Hands seek to emulate their deity Torm, who is known for his steadfast loyalty and dedication to all that is good.  While a great many of his worshipers are Champions (known as Paladins or Holy Champions of Torm), as Torm is the patron of Paladinhood, Hands are no less fierce and loyal to the cause of their god (if slightly less martial).

Advantages:
- Hands are special among clerics in that they gain focus in the protection sphere.
- Hands can cast Command as a spell like ability once per day.  <PRO_HESHE> can use this ability an additional time at levels 5, 10, 15, and 20.
- Hands are able to gain proficiency in any weapon or fighting style.  They can gain 2 pips in sword and shield fighting style.
- At 3rd level, a hand can cast detect evil as a spell like ability, once per day.  They gain an additional use of this ability at levels 7, 10, 13, 16 and 19.
- At 4th level, a hand can cast protection from evil as a spell like ability once per day.  They can use this ability an additional time at levels 8, 12, 16 and 20.

Restrictions:
- Alignment: Lawful good, lawful neutral, or neutral good only.
- Multiclass: Fighter/Clerics can be Hands of Torm.

@20503  = ~LUCKRIDER OF TYMORA: Also known as Lady Luck, Tymora is the goddess of good fortune. The sect of her clerics known as Luckriders eat, drink, and sleep luck. Confident to the point of cockiness, they enter battle recklessly, throwing caution to the wind and trusting in fate. Considering how many adventurers perish despite crafting meticulous strategies and plans, this is not a ridiculous position.
 
Advantages:
- Luckriders are innately lucky, receiving the effects of the Luck spell permanently.
- May cast an area-of-effect "Tymora's Luck" spell innately once per day, and once more for each 5 levels of experience gained.

TYMORA'S LUCK:

The allies of this spellcaster gain extraordinary luck for the next 1 turn, receiving a +1 bonus to their saving throws, attack rolls, and minimum damage/healing rolls as well as +5% to all thieving skills. Furthermore, damage dice for all effects outside a weapon's base damage is reduced by 1. Finally, spells that offer saving throws to enemies are more likely to be effective: a spell that usually offers a saving throw with no penalty will instead offer a saving throw with a -2 penalty.

Restrictions:
- Alignment: may not Lawful or Evil.
- Multiclass: Cleric/Thieves can be Luckriders

// ... cleric of helm:
//
@20801 = ~cleric of helm~
@20802 = ~Watcher of Helm~
@20803 = ~WATCHER OF HELM:
Advantages:
- Watchers automatically gain a proficiency point in longsword, Helm's favored weapon.  Fighter clerics do not get this bonus, but they are able to gain mastery with the longsword.
- Heightened Awareness: +1 bonus to AC and +2 bonus to save vs breath
- Can cast Helm's eye as a special ability once per day at 9th level.  The watcher gains an additional use at levels 11, 13, 15, 17 and 19. Helm's eye is equivalent to the wizard spell, wizard eye.
- Can cast Seeking Sword as a special ability once per day.  The Watcher gains an additional use at levels 4, 8, 12, 16 and 20.

SEEKING SWORD: This spell creates a sword in the Cleric's hand that cannot be dropped or unequipped. The sword is enchanted as a +4 weapon and provides a +4 THAC0 bonus, but no damage bonus. It deals 2d4 damage to any target it hits. The weapon sets the Cleric's number of attacks per round to 3 and lasts for 1 round per level. While it is equipped, the wielder cannot cast further spells.

Restrictions:
- Alignment: May be Lawful Good, Lawful Neutral, or True Neutral.

@20807 = ~Helm's Eye

Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is employed, the priest creates an invisible sensory organ that sends him visual information. Helm's Eye can see with normal vision up to 60 ft. away in brightly lit areas, and can travel in any direction as long as the spell lasts. It has substance and a form that can be detected (by a Detect Invisibility spell, for instance). Solid barriers prevent the passage of Helm's Eye. The powers of the eye cannot be enhanced by other spells or items. The caster is subject to any gaze attack met by the eye. A successful Dispel Magic spell cast on the wizard or the eye ends the spell.

//
// ... cleric of tempus:
//
@21001 = ~cleric of tempus~
@21002 = ~Battleguard of Tempus~
@21003 = ~BATTLEGUARD OF TEMPUS:  Tempus, also known as the Lord of Battles or the Foehammer, is random in his favors, yet his chaotic nature favors all sides equally. Lord Tempus may be on an army's side one day and against them the next; such is the nature of war. Tempuran clergy can be found on both sides of a conflict, as none can ever truly know whom the war god will favor.

Advantages:
- Battleguards can be proficient with any weapon
- Battleguards gain a +1 bonus to damage with any melee weapon.
- Incite Rage: Battleguards can incite a berserker rage beginning at level 5, and again at levels 10, 15 and 20.  This ability is like the berserkers enrage, except that <PRO_HESHE> can incite this rage in <PRO_HIMHER>self or in others.

Restrictions:
- Alignment: No alignment restrictions.
- Multiclass: Cleric/Fighters can be Battleguards

The character also gains 15 temporary Hit Points, which are taken away at the end of the berserk spree (possibly knocking the character unconscious).

After the effects end, the character becomes winded, suffering a -2 penalty to Armor Class, to-hit rolls, and damage rolls.~

She was supposedly slain under mysterious circumstances during the Avatar crisis, but at least one sect of her worshippers, the Mistwalkers, continue to receive divine power. Lies are their currency, illusion is their tool.
 
Advantages:
- May use the "Leira's Double" ability once every 5 rounds. Often used in emergencies, this causes an illusionary double of the cleric to spring into existence. If the cleric is being attacked, the double will absorb the first blow that lands, and disappear. At 6th level two doubles are created, and at 12th level one of the two doubles can actually wander away from the cleric to distract enemies. Mistwalkers may use this ability once per turn.

Restrictions:
- May not dual-class to fighter.
- Alignment: may not be Lawful.

@21903  = ~PAINGIVER OF LOVIATAR: Known as The Maiden of Pain and The Willing Whip, loviatar is the evil goddess of agony. She is often seen as a cold-hearted bully, calculating and despotic; she revels in inflicting physical and psychological suffering. Her priests, known simply as "Paingivers" find freedom and power in such pain, and they seek to spread that gospel to others... regardless whether their victims are actually seeking such enlightenment.

Advantages:
- Can use the Pain Touch ability at will.
PAIN TOUCH:
When the priest of Lovitar activates this ability, her mere touch creates waves of pain for any creature with a nervous system.  When she touches any creature, they must save vs death or suffer a -2 penalty to their dexterity and -4 to thac0 as they writhe in agony and will suffer 1 point of non-lethal damage every 12 seconds.
The penalties and damage occurs over an excruciating period of 10 rounds.
Paingivers have have this touch indefinitely, but they can suppress it as needed.
- At 3rd level, Paingivers can use Loviatar's Caress once per day.  <PRO_HESHE> can use this ability one more time at levels 6, 9, 12, 15 and 18.
LOVIATAR'S CARESS:

When the cleric uses this ability, <PRO_HISHER> hands become instruments of Lovitar for four rounds.  <PRO_HESHE> can strike with uncanny accuracy with <PRO_HISHER> hands (+10 to hit) and <PRO_HESHE> inflicts an additional +2 points of damage per level to a maximum of +20 points at 10th level.  This spell stacks with other unarmed attacks, such as the priest's pain touch.

BLACK BEAR: in bear form, the Druid has 19 strength. He can attack twice per round with claws that cause 1d6 crushing damage and 1d6 slashing damage.

@70001  = ~mystic~
@70002  = ~Mystic~
@70003  = ~MYSTICS: Through study and meditation, Mystics form a spiritual connection with some aspect of the natural world, and channel energy through that connection to create magical effects. This art has been practiced in some fashion since the dawn of time, before there were religions or deities; some say Mystics are the original magic-users. 

PURE MYSTICS form a deep, spiritual connection with a fundamental aspect of the universe: one of the prime elements, or light or shadow. The magic that flows through them is raw and powerful, but their ability to shape it is limited to effects closely related to their focus.

DRUIDS are a branch of Mystics focused on the balanced combinations of elemental energies that result in living ecosystems. At the direction of the deities Sylvanus and Chauntea, they have organized themselves into ordered hierarchies in which to teach and practice their abilities. They have mastery over various facets of the natural world: different chapters specialize in particular environments, such as forests, jungles, mountains, and deserts.

OCCULTISTS learn to tap magical power in nontraditional ways. Through study and unnatural experiments, they can learn to harness the boiling energies of the inner planes, or infernal powers from the outer planes, or the wild, animal nature seething inside every man and woman. Some have even learned to steal magical energy from the deities themselves - calling into question whether those beings are truly omnipotent.

All of these classes share some common attributes. Creating and maintaining the spiritual connections to perform this type of magic is very demanding. Therefore, they may not spare the time to master the use of complicated or martial weapons; they are excluded from using 2-handed swords, halberds, katanas, bastard swords, long swords, flails, morning stars, maces, and crossbows.

Most Druids now consider Nature Mystics to be heretics, practicing a dangerous and less refined version of their art.

Advantages:

@73103  = ~FOREST DRUID: Forest Druids reside in the regions where soil is nutritious, plant life is abundant and animals thrive. Tall forests are a paradise in many ways: they provide shade from the sun, food and homes for animals and people, and wood for tools. While other wildlands can be wondrous escapes, forests are incessantly under threat of being torn down and subjugated by careless humans and demihumans. Forest druids therefore often live with a constant low-grade paranoia, which informs the stereotype of druids being hostile to civilization.

Advantages:
- At 1st level, may summon a Spirit Wolf. The HD of the spirit animal increases to match the druid's level at 3rd, 5th, 7th and 10th level.
- At 2nd level, may shapeshift into the form of a wolf. At 7th level this grows to a stronger dire wolf form.
- At 5th level, may shapeshift into the form of a ferret.
- At 9th level, may shapeshift into the form of a black bear.
- 15th level: Gains 10% resistance to cold, fire, electricity, and acid; gains a further 10% resistance at levels 18 and 21.

WOLF: in wolf form the druid can detect hidden enemies. He can attack 1.5 times per round for 2d3 slashing damage.

FERRET: in ferret form the druid is hidden from view for up to three rounds. He can attack once per round, causing 1d2 damage; if the target fails a save vs. death, the wound causes disease that saps the targets strength for one turn, and distraction that causes a 10% chance of spell failure.

BLACK BEAR: in bear form, the Druid has 19 strength. He can attack twice per round with claws that cause 1d6 crushing damage and 1d6 slashing damage.

@90002  = ~Ranger~
@90003  = ~RANGERS: The general term 'Ranger' includes several varieties of hardy warriors which share certain characteristics: they are strong fighters, and they are skilled in stealth and scouting. In battle, rangers favor quickness and skill over brute force. They often use light, single-handed weapons, and are adept and wielding a weapon in each hand simultaneously.

SCOUTS are warriors who may not be particularly spiritual, but tend to share certain values and combat tactics with Rangers. They have very little magical abilities - generally only a couple spells connected to their particular abilities. Instead they develop skills through sheer determination, learning techniques and abilities that help them survive.

"TRUE RANGERS" are masters of their local geography, learning skills that allow them to survive in the harsh wilderness where few others could. They have access to spheres of magic relating to the environment in which they specialize, similar to druids. Rangers are generally good-natured and protective of their fellow men, using their skills to support and provide for communities in wild frontiers.

Range: 0
Duration: 2 turns
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

This spell summons forth a silent, weightless sword-like construct made of moonlight that extends four feet from the caster's hand. The moonblade is considered a +4 weapon for determining what creatures it can hit, though the bonus does not apply to attack rolls made with it. In addition, due to the insubstantial nature of the moonblade, melee bonuses from Strength do not apply.

The strike of a moonblade drains a target's vitality, inflicting 1d12+4 points of magic damage, plus an additional 1d12 points to undead, who are particularly susceptible. A successful strike also temporarily scrambles magic, causing any spells the target casts in the next round to fail.~
